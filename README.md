# Inter-Processor-Communication-Debugger
1. Introduction
  Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is essential for enabling processes to exchange data and synchronize execution. The IPC Debugger is a specialized tool designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize IPC mechanisms within      multi-core and distributed computing environments. It helps detect communication inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and potential bottlenecks in message exchanges.

2. Features
  Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks message exchanges and logs communication events.
  Performance Analysis: Identifies delays, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies in IPC mechanisms.
  Error Detection & Debugging: Detects deadlocks, race conditions, and failed message transmissions.
  Security & Encryption: Implements cryptographic measures to secure IPC messages.
  User-Friendly Interface: Provides a visual representation of IPC interactions.

3. Working Mechanism
   
  A. Data Collection
    The debugger captures IPC events in real time using system monitoring tools.
    Logs detailed timestamps, process IDs, and message contents.

  B. Performance Analysis
    Evaluates communication latency and throughput.
    Suggests optimization strategies to improve IPC efficiency.

  C. Error Detection
